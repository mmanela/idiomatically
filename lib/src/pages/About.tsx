      <Paragraph>
        Idiomatically is a site all about ...{" "}
        <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/idiom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          idioms
        </a>
        .
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Idioms are those expressions that just don't make sense if you take them literally; but they are what make language
        interesting and colorful. They are much more than the sum of their parts - they are the linguistic equivalent of a{" "}
        <Text underline>picture is worth a thousand words</Text>. They exist in every language and native speakers barely even notice them.
        However, if you try talking to someone who grew up speaking a different language
        you will occasionally notice blank stares when you use one.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        This realization is the genesis of this site. The goal of Idiomatically is to provide a repository of idioms across
        different languages and countries (Idioms in a language are not ubiquitous in all countries speaking that language). It
        also provides relationships between different languages.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        For example, to express <Text strong>Kill two birds with one stone</Text> in Bulgarian, Idiomatically will
        direct you to <Text strong>С един куршум - два заека</Text> (Kill two rabbits with one bullet). It is interesting
        to watch how different languages can express the same concept in seemingly similar but often interestingly different ways.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Every idiom page allows you to explore all the equivalent idioms in different languages/countries as a list and as an interactive map.
